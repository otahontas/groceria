# Groceria
Plain and simple self-hostable groceries web app, built with react and typescript. This is one those apps, where I couldn't find self-hostable alternative suited for my use-case, so why not create a new app. (Also, shouldn't everyone have a todoapp in their portfolio?).

## Goals
- SPA with literally only one page, no separate lists, just one list for groceries
- Saves entries to JSON
- No separate users
- Optionally password protection for page
- Easy deployment to VPS with Docker

## Usage
- Installation: yarn install
- Starting: yarn start
- Testing: yarn test
- Building: yarn build

## Licence
MIT
